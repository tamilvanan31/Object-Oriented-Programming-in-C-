/*
Encapsulation in defined as binding together the data and the 
function that manipulates them. 
Both Abstraction & Encapsulation works hand in hand because 
Abstraction says what details to be made visible and Encapsulation 
provides the level of access right to that visible details. 
i.e. â€“ It implements the desired level of abstraction.
